Running install-unhappy tests...


=== BEGIN ERR-01: Install non-existent package ===

-- UNKNOWN PACKAGE -------------------------------------------------------------

I could not find 'wrap/does-not-exist' in the package registry, but I found
these packages with similar names:

    elm/bytes
    elm/browser
    elm/core
    elm/json

Maybe you want one of these instead?

[Registry since-count: 30 -> 30 (Δ0)]
=== END ERR-01 ===

=== BEGIN ERR-02: Install package with non-existent version ===
[ERROR] Version 9.9.9 not found for package wrap/package-3v-no-deps
Available versions:
  3.0.0
  2.0.0
  1.0.0
[Registry since-count: 30 -> 30 (Δ0)]
=== END ERR-02 ===

=== BEGIN ERR-03: Install multiple packages with one non-existent ===
-- PACKAGE VALIDATION FAILED --------------------------------------------------

I cannot install these requested packages:

  ✗ wrap/does-not-exist - Package not found in registry

Please fix the specification and try again.

I didn't install anything yet, as I can only install all specified packages or none.
[Registry since-count: 30 -> 30 (Δ0)]
