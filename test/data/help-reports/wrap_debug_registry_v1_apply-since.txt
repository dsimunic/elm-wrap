Usage: wrap debug registry_v1 apply-since JSON_PATH

Apply a /since JSON response offline.

This command processes a registry /since endpoint JSON response
that has been saved to a file, and applies the updates to the
local registry.dat file. This is useful for testing or debugging
registry synchronization without making network requests.
