Usage: wrap debug registry_v1 reset [--yes|-y]

Delete registry.dat and re-download it.

This command removes the local V1 protocol registry.dat file
and its associated metadata (ETag, since count), then downloads
a fresh copy from the registry server. This is useful when the
local registry cache becomes corrupted or out of sync.

Options:
  -y, --yes    Assume yes for prompts (skip confirmation)
  -h, --help   Show this help message
