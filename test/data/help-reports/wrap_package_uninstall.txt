Usage:
  wrap package uninstall PACKAGE [PACKAGE...]
  wrap package uninstall --local-dev

Remove packages from your Elm project.

Use --local-dev (run from within an Elm package directory) to remove the
current package from local-dev tracking.

This will also remove any indirect dependencies that are no longer
needed by other packages.

Alias: 'package remove' can be used instead of 'package uninstall'.

Examples:
  wrap package uninstall elm/html           # Remove elm/html from your project
  wrap package uninstall elm/html elm/json  # Remove multiple packages at once
  wrap package uninstall --local-dev        # Remove current package from local-dev tracking

Options:
  --local-dev                        # Remove current package from local-dev tracking
  -y, --yes                          # Automatically confirm changes
  --help                             # Show this help
